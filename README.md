## Project Description
We want to create a web tool that allows users to sort, filter, and catalog TV shows, similar to what Letterboxd allows for movies. Users would be able to search for shows similar shows, rate shows that they've watched, find which streaming services stream their favorite shows, and create watchlists to share with others.
